# mobile-menu-react-ts-template
Simple template of a mobile-like menu in static sidebar with buttons and animated conteiners for subitems.

Template is based on another template I frequently use: [link](https://github.com/YesIDont/react-type-script-template)

## Preview
<img src="./demo/menu-demo.gif" width="450" style="max-width: 100%" />

## How to?
Download repo, in your command line run:
- ```yarn``` to install dependencies
- ```yarn start``` to run dev server  

## Stack
- React 17+
- TypeScript 4+
- StyledComponents 5+
- MobX 6+ / mobx-react 7+ (not required for menu to function but included in the template since I usually use it to manage global state)
